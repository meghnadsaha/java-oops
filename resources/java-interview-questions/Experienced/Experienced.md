Certainly! Here are detailed explanations with examples for the Java interview questions you've asked:

1. **Although inheritance is a popular OOPs concept, it is less advantageous than composition. Explain.**

    - **Composition:** Combines objects of different classes to create more complex objects. It promotes code reuse and is flexible.
    - **Advantages over Inheritance:**
        - **Flexibility:** Classes can be easily changed with composition without affecting client code.
        - **Encapsulation:** Objects can hide their implementation details.
        - **Maintainability:** Changes are localized and easier to manage.

   ```java
   // Example of Composition
   class Engine {
       public void start() {
           // Engine start logic
       }
   }

   class Car {
       private Engine engine; // Composition

       public Car() {
           this.engine = new Engine();
       }

       public void startCar() {
           engine.start(); // Delegating start functionality
       }
   }
   ```

2. **What is the difference between ‘>>’ and ‘>>>’ operators in Java?**

    - **`>>` (Signed Right Shift):** Shifts bits to the right. Preserves the sign bit (sign-extension).

    - **`>>>` (Unsigned Right Shift):** Shifts bits to the right. Fills the leftmost bits with zeros (zero-extension).

   ```java
   int num = -8;
   System.out.println(num >> 1);  // Output: -4
   System.out.println(num >>> 1); // Output: 2147483644
   ```

3. **What are Composition and Aggregation? State the difference.**

    - **Composition:** Strong relationship where one class (whole) owns another class (part) and the part cannot exist without the whole. The part's lifecycle is managed by the whole.
    - **Aggregation:** Weaker relationship where one class (whole) contains another class (part) but the part can exist independently. The part's lifecycle is not managed by the whole.

   ```java
   // Composition Example
   class Engine {
       // Engine details
   }

   class Car {
       private Engine engine; // Composition

       public Car() {
           this.engine = new Engine();
       }
   }

   // Aggregation Example
   class Department {
       // Department details
   }

   class University {
       private Department[] departments; // Aggregation
   }
   ```

4. **How is the creation of a String using new() different from that of a literal?**

    - **Using `new String()`:** Always creates a new String object in heap memory, even if the string value already exists in the string pool.
    - **Using String literal (`" "`):** Checks the string pool first. If the string already exists, it returns the reference to it; otherwise, it creates a new string in the pool.

   ```java
   String str1 = new String("Hello"); // Creates new object in heap
   String str2 = "Hello"; // Checks string pool and reuses existing "Hello"
   ```

5. **How is the ‘new’ operator different from the ‘newInstance()’ operator in Java?**

    - **`new` Operator:** Creates a new instance of a class at compile-time.

    - **`newInstance()` Method:** Part of the `java.lang.reflect.Constructor` class. Creates a new instance of a class at runtime using reflection.

   ```java
   // Using new operator
   MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();

   // Using newInstance() method
   Class<?> clazz = MyClass.class;
   MyClass obj2 = (MyClass) clazz.newInstance();
   ```

6. **Is exceeding the memory limit possible in a program despite having a garbage collector?**

   Yes, it is possible to exceed the memory limit if the program allocates more memory than available (e.g., due to a memory leak). Garbage collector manages memory deallocation of unreachable objects but cannot prevent memory allocation errors.

7. **Why is synchronization necessary? Explain with the help of a relevant example.**

    - **Necessity:** Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access shared resources (e.g., variables or methods) at a time, preventing race conditions and maintaining data integrity.

   ```java
   class Counter {
       private int count = 0;

       public synchronized void increment() {
           count++;
       }

       public synchronized int getCount() {
           return count;
       }
   }
   ```

8. **In the given code below, what is the significance of ... ?**

   To provide an answer, I'll need to see the specific code you're referring to.

9. **What will be the output of the below java program and define the steps of Execution of the java program with the help of the below code?**

   To provide an accurate answer, I'll need to see the specific Java program you're referring to.

10. **Define System.out.println().**

    - **System:** Class in `java.lang` package.
    - **out:** `static` field of `System` class (type `PrintStream`).
    - **println():** Method of `PrintStream` class. Prints the argument and advances the cursor to the next line.

    ```java
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    ```

11. **Can you explain the Java thread lifecycle?**

    - **New:** Thread instance created.
    - **Runnable:** Thread ready to run (calling `start()`).
    - **Running:** Thread executing `run()` method.
    - **Blocked:** Waiting for a monitor lock.
    - **Waiting:** Waiting indefinitely for another thread.
    - **Timed Waiting:** Waiting for a specified amount of time.
    - **Terminated:** Thread completes execution (after `run()` method ends or `stop()` is called).

12. **What could be the tradeoff between the usage of an unordered array versus the usage of an ordered array?**

    - **Unordered Array:** Faster insertion and deletion but slower search operations (`O(n)`).
    - **Ordered Array:** Slower insertion and deletion (requires shifting) but faster search operations (`O(log n)` using binary search).

13. **Is it possible to import the same class or package twice in Java and what happens to it during runtime?**

    - **Class:** No, importing the same class twice causes a compile-time error.
    - **Package:** Importing the same package multiple times is allowed and has no impact on runtime behavior.

14. **In case a package has sub packages, will it suffice to import only the main package? e.g. Does importing of com.myMainPackage.* also import com.myMainPackage.mySubPackage.*?**

    No, importing `com.myMainPackage.*` imports only classes directly within `com.myMainPackage`. It does not import classes from sub-packages like `com.myMainPackage.mySubPackage`.

15. **Will the finally block be executed if the code System.exit(0) is written at the end of try block?**

    No, `System.exit(0)` terminates the JVM, preventing execution of any further code including the `finally` block.

16. **What do you understand by marker interfaces in Java?**

    Marker interfaces in Java have no methods or fields. They serve as a tag to inform the compiler that the classes implementing them have a certain behavior or characteristic.

    ```java
    interface Serializable {
        // Marker interface for objects that can be serialized
    }
    ```

17. **Explain the term “Double Brace Initialization” in Java?**

    Double Brace Initialization is a shorthand way to initialize collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) in Java using an anonymous inner class and an instance initializer block.

    ```java
    ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>() {{
        add("One");
        add("Two");
    }};
    ```

18. **Why is it said that the length() method of String class doesn't return accurate results?**

    The `length()` method of the `String` class returns the number of characters in the string. It's accurate for non-Unicode strings. For Unicode strings (composed of surrogate pairs), it returns the number of 16-bit `char` values, not actual characters.

19. **What is the output of the below code and why?**

    To provide an accurate answer, I'll need to see the specific Java code you're referring to.

20. **What are the possible ways of making an object eligible for garbage collection (GC) in Java?**

    - **Nullifying Reference:** Assigning `null` to an object reference.
    - **Reassigning Reference:** Reassigning the reference to another object.
    - **Isolation:** Ensuring no live thread can access the object.
    - **End of Scope:** Local variables go out of scope.

    ```java
    MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    obj = null; // Eligible for GC after this line
    ```

21. **In the below Java Program, how many objects are eligible for garbage collection?**

    To determine this, I would need to see the specific Java program you're referring to and analyze object references and their scopes.

22. **What is the best way to inject dependency? Also, state the reason.**

    Dependency Injection (DI) is the best way to inject dependencies because it promotes loose coupling and easier unit testing. Types of DI include Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and Interface Injection.

    ```java
    class MyClass {
        private Dependency dependency;

        // Constructor Injection
        public MyClass(Dependency dependency) {
            this.dependency = dependency;
        }

        // Getter and Setter Injection
        public void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {
            this.dependency = dependency;
        }
    }
    ```

23. **How can we set the Spring bean scope? And what

supported scopes does it have?**

    Spring bean scope can be set using the `@Scope` annotation or XML configuration. Supported scopes include Singleton (default), Prototype, Request, Session, and more depending on the context and configuration.

    ```java
    @Component
    @Scope("prototype")
    public class MyBean {
        // Bean definition
    }
    ```

24. **What are the different categories of Java Design patterns?**

    Java Design Patterns are categorized into three main categories:
    - **Creational Patterns:** Concerned with object creation mechanisms.
    - **Structural Patterns:** Focus on class and object composition.
    - **Behavioral Patterns:** Address how objects interact and distribute responsibilities.

25. **What is a Memory Leak? Discuss some common causes of it.**

    Memory Leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to release it when no longer needed. Causes include:
    - Unintentional Object Retention.
    - Improper use of Static References.
    - Unclosed Resources.
    - Caches and Collection Growth.

26. **Assume a thread has a lock on it, calling the sleep() method on that thread will release the lock?**

    No, calling `sleep()` method does not release the lock held by the thread. The thread retains the lock until it explicitly releases it or exits the synchronized block/method.

These explanations with examples should help you understand these Java concepts thoroughly. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
