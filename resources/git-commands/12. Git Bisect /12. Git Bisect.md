### 12. Git Bisect

#### Introduction: Git Bisect

Git bisect is a powerful tool for finding which commit introduced a bug by performing a binary search through the commit history. It helps pinpoint exactly where the issue was introduced, making it easier to fix.

#### Bisecting: The Session at a High Level

In a `git bisect` session, Git automatically navigates through commits, prompting you to mark each commit as good or bad until it identifies the exact commit that introduced the bug.

#### A Real 'git bisect' Session

Let's simulate a real-world scenario where we use `git bisect` to identify the commit that introduced a bug.

#### Scenario

Assume we have a repository with a bug that appeared recently. We know the bug did not exist a few commits ago. We want to use `git bisect` to find out when it was introduced.

#### Commands and Output

1. **Start the bisect session:**

   Begin the bisect session by telling Git the known bad commit (HEAD, where the bug exists) and the last known good commit (a few commits ago).

   ```bash
   $ git bisect start
   $ git bisect bad           # Current HEAD is bad
   $ git bisect good HEAD~10  # A commit 10 commits ago was good
   ```

   Git will start bisecting between the known good and bad commits (`HEAD` and `HEAD~10` in this example).

2. **Mark commits as good or bad:**

   Git will automatically checkout a commit between the good and bad range and prompt you to test it.

   ```bash
   Bisecting: 5 revisions left to test after this (roughly 3 steps)
   [a1b2c3d] Fix issue with authentication
   # Test the commit to see if it contains the bug
   $ git bisect good  # Commit is good
   ```

   Based on your testing, mark the commit as `good` or `bad`. Git will narrow down the range based on your feedback.

3. **Continue marking commits:**

   Git will continue bisecting, automatically checking out commits and prompting you to test them until it identifies the first bad commit.

   ```bash
   Bisecting: 2 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)
   [e5f6g7h] Introduce bug in user authentication
   # Test the commit to see if it contains the bug
   $ git bisect bad  # Commit is bad
   ```

4. **Identify the bad commit:**

   After marking enough commits, Git will identify the first bad commit that introduced the bug.

   ```bash
   Bisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 1 step)
   [e5f6g7h] Introduce bug in user authentication
   Bisecting: found bad commit e5f6g7h
   ```

   Git informs you that commit `e5f6g7h` is the first bad commit that introduced the bug.

5. **End the bisect session:**

   Once Git identifies the bad commit, end the bisect session.

   ```bash
   $ git bisect reset
   ```

   This resets the repository to the original `HEAD` state and ends the bisect session.

### Explanation

- **Git Bisect Start (`git bisect start`)**: Initiates a new bisect session.
- **Marking Commits (`git bisect good` / `git bisect bad`)**: Tells Git whether the current commit is good (bug-free) or bad (contains the bug).
- **Bisecting Process**: Git automatically navigates through commits, narrowing down the range based on your feedback until it identifies the commit that introduced the bug.
- **Identifying the Bad Commit**: Git identifies and informs you of the first bad commit that introduced the bug.
- **Git Bisect Reset (`git bisect reset`)**: Ends the bisect session and resets the repository to the original `HEAD` state.

Git bisect is invaluable for efficiently identifying the cause of bugs by systematically narrowing down the range of commits that might have introduced the issue, saving time and effort in debugging.
