### Scenario: Working With Multiple Git Repositories

#### Introduction: Working With Multiple Repositories

In software development, it's common to work with multiple Git repositories simultaneously, especially in projects that involve microservices, libraries, or modular components. This scenario demonstrates how to manage and work with three linked repositories: `repo_a`, `repo_b`, and `repo_c`.

#### Three-Linked Repositories

Assume we have three interconnected repositories:
- `repo_a`: Core repository containing shared libraries.
- `repo_b`: Application repository that depends on `repo_a`.
- `repo_c`: Development repository for a new feature, also dependent on `repo_a`.

#### Example Commands and Output

1. **Clone repositories:**

   Start by cloning the three repositories (`repo_a`, `repo_b`, `repo_c`) to your local machine.

   ```bash
   # Clone repo_a
   $ git clone https://github.com/username/repo_a.git
   $ cd repo_a

   # Clone repo_b
   $ git clone https://github.com/username/repo_b.git
   $ cd repo_b

   # Clone repo_c
   $ git clone https://github.com/username/repo_c.git
   $ cd repo_c
   ```

2. **Navigate and set up dependencies:**

   Navigate into each repository and set up dependencies between them. Assume `repo_b` and `repo_c` depend on `repo_a`.

   ```bash
   # In repo_b and repo_c, set repo_a as a submodule or dependency
   $ cd /path/to/repo_b
   $ git submodule add https://github.com/username/repo_a.git

   $ cd /path/to/repo_c
   $ git submodule add https://github.com/username/repo_a.git
   ```

   This sets up `repo_a` as a submodule or dependency in `repo_b` and `repo_c`.

3. **Make changes in `repo_a`:**

   Assume a change is made in `repo_a` that affects both `repo_b` and `repo_c`.

   ```bash
   $ cd /path/to/repo_a
   # Make changes to shared libraries
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Update shared libraries"
   $ git push origin main
   ```

   Push changes to `repo_a` after making modifications.

4. **Fetch changes in `repo_b` and `repo_c`:**

   Fetch changes from `repo_a` into `repo_b` and `repo_c` to synchronize with the latest changes.

   ```bash
   $ cd /path/to/repo_b
   $ git fetch origin
   $ git merge origin/main

   $ cd /path/to/repo_c
   $ git fetch origin
   $ git merge origin/main
   ```

   This fetches and merges changes from `repo_a` (`origin/main`) into `repo_b` and `repo_c`.

### Explanation

- **Cloning Repositories**: Start by cloning the required repositories (`repo_a`, `repo_b`, `repo_c`) to your local machine.
- **Setting Up Dependencies**: Use submodules or other dependency management mechanisms to link `repo_a` with `repo_b` and `repo_c`.
- **Making Changes**: Make changes in `repo_a` that are shared among the repositories.
- **Fetching and Merging Changes**: Use `git fetch` and `git merge` to pull changes from `repo_a` into `repo_b` and `repo_c`, keeping all repositories synchronized.

This scenario demonstrates how to effectively manage and work with multiple interconnected Git repositories, ensuring that changes in shared dependencies (`repo_a`) are propagated correctly to dependent repositories (`repo_b` and `repo_c`). This approach facilitates modular development and collaboration in complex projects.
