Certainly! Here's a detailed scenario where you accidentally push a commit and need to undo it using Git commands, along with proper terminal command outputs:

### Scenario: Undoing a Pushed Commit

**1. Initial Setup:**
Assume you have a Git repository (`my-project`) with a remote repository (`origin`) where you've accidentally pushed a commit (`abcdefg`) that needs to be undone.

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
   cd my-project
   ```

**2. Identify the commit to undo:**
- View the commit history to identify the commit (`abcdefg`) that was pushed and needs to be undone.

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
Output:
   ```
   abcdefg (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Fix issue #123: Updated README
   hijklmn Previous commit
   ```

In this example, `abcdefg` is the commit that needs to be undone.

**3. Undo the commit locally:**
- Use `git revert` to create a new commit that reverses the changes introduced by commit `abcdefg`.

   ```bash
   git revert abcdefg
   ```
Output:
   ```
   [main 1234567] Revert "Fix issue #123: Updated README"
    1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
   ```

This command creates a new commit (`1234567`) that effectively undoes the changes made by commit `abcdefg`.

**4. Verify the commit history:**
- Check the commit log to ensure that the revert commit (`1234567`) is recorded properly.

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
Output:
   ```
   1234567 (HEAD -> main) Revert "Fix issue #123: Updated README"
   abcdefg Fix issue #123: Updated README
   hijklmn Previous commit
   ```

Now, `1234567` is the latest commit on the `main` branch, which reverses the changes from `abcdefg`.

**5. Push the revert commit to remote repository:**
- Push the revert commit (`1234567`) to the remote repository (`origin`) to apply the reversal of changes.

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
Output:
   ```
   Counting objects: 3, done.
   Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
   Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 310 bytes | 310.00 KiB/s, done.
   Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
   To https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
      abc1234..1234567  main -> main
   ```

The revert commit (`1234567`) is now pushed to the remote repository (`origin`), effectively undoing the changes from `abcdefg`.

**6. Verify changes on remote repository:**
- Optionally, check the commit history on the remote repository (`origin`) to ensure that the revert commit is visible.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git log --oneline origin/main
   ```
Output:
   ```
   1234567 (origin/main, origin/HEAD) Revert "Fix issue #123: Updated README"
   abcdefg Fix issue #123: Updated README
   hijklmn Previous commit
   ```

The remote repository now reflects the revert commit (`1234567`), and `abcdefg` is still present in the history but its changes have been effectively undone.

In this scenario, you successfully used Git commands to undo a pushed commit (`abcdefg`) by creating a revert commit (`1234567`) and pushing it to the remote repository (`origin`). Always ensure to communicate such changes with your team to keep everyone informed and maintain project consistency.
