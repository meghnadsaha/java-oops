Certainly! Here's a scenario where we encounter a merge conflict in Git due to conflicting modifications in the same file:

### Scenario: Merge Conflict Resolution

**1. Initial Setup:**
You have a Git repository with a remote named `origin`. There are two branches: `main` and `feature-branch`.

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
Output:
   ```
   * main
     feature-branch
   ```

**2. Make conflicting changes:**
- Checkout the `feature-branch` and make changes to a file `example.txt`.

   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   echo "Line 1: Feature Branch Content" > example.txt
   git add example.txt
   git commit -m "Added feature branch content to example.txt"
   ```
Output:
   ```
   [feature-branch abc1234] Added feature branch content to example.txt
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
   ```

- Switch to `main` branch and make conflicting changes to the same file `example.txt`.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   echo "Line 1: Main Branch Content" > example.txt
   git add example.txt
   git commit -m "Added main branch content to example.txt"
   ```
Output:
   ```
   [main def5678] Added main branch content to example.txt
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
   ```

**3. Attempt to merge branches:**
- Try to merge `feature-branch` into `main`.

   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```
Output:
   ```
   Auto-merging example.txt
   CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in example.txt
   Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
   ```

Git detects a conflict in `example.txt` because both branches have made changes to the same line (`Line 1`).

**4. Resolve the merge conflict:**
- Open `example.txt` in your preferred text editor. You will see Git's conflict markers:

   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Line 1: Main Branch Content
   =======
   Line 1: Feature Branch Content
   >>>>>>> feature-branch
   ```

- Edit `example.txt` to keep the desired content (e.g., choose between `Main Branch Content` or `Feature Branch Content`). Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

   ```plaintext
   Line 1: Main Branch Content
   Line 1: Feature Branch Content
   ```

- Save the file and stage it for commit.

   ```bash
   git add example.txt

   ```plaintext
   Line 1: Main Branch Content
   Line 1: Feature Branch Content
   ```

- Save the file and stage it for commit.

   ```bash
   git add example.txt
   git commit
   ```

This will open your editor to provide a merge commit message. Save and close the editor to complete the merge commit.

**5. Verify the merge:**
- Check the commit history to verify the merge.

   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph
   ```
Output should show a merge commit that resolves the conflict:

   ```
   *   Merge branch 'feature-branch' into main
   |\
   | * feature-branch commit
   * | main branch commit
   |/
   * initial commit
   ```

This scenario demonstrates how to handle a merge conflict in Git due to conflicting modifications in the same file (`example.txt`). Resolving merge conflicts involves manually editing the conflicted file, removing conflict markers, staging the resolved file, and then completing the merge commit. Always ensure to communicate changes with team members to maintain code integrity.
