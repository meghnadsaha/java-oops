### Challenge: Git Stash

Let's delve into a scenario where Git stash can be utilized effectively, choosing the appropriate stash and managing multiple stashes.

#### Scenario

You are working on a feature branch (`feature-branch`) and have made some changes that are not ready to be committed yet. However, your team lead urgently assigns you to fix a critical bug on the `main` branch. You need to stash your changes on `feature-branch`, switch to `main` to address the bug, and later decide which stashed changes to apply when you return to `feature-branch`.

#### Commands

1. **Check current status:**

   Before stashing, review the current status to identify changes that need stashing:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Stash your changes with a message:**

   Stash your changes on `feature-branch` with a descriptive message to identify it later:

   ```bash
   git stash save "WIP: Work in progress on feature XYZ"
   ```

3. **List all stashes:**

   View all stashes to identify the one you want to apply later:

   ```bash
   git stash list
   ```

4. **Switch to another branch (`main` in this case):**

   Switch to the `main` branch to fix the urgent bug:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

5. **Fix the critical bug on `main` branch:**

   Address the urgent bug or perform necessary tasks on the `main` branch.

6. **Switch back to your feature branch (`feature-branch`):**

   After fixing the bug, switch back to `feature-branch` to continue working on your feature:

   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

7. **Apply the chosen stash:**

   Apply the specific stash you chose earlier to restore your work in progress:

   ```bash
   git stash apply stash@{n}
   ```

   Replace `stash@{n}` with the appropriate stash reference from the list (`stash@{0}`, `stash@{1}`, etc.).

8. **Optional: Delete the applied stash (if no longer needed):**

   If you've successfully applied the stash and no longer need it, you can delete it from the stash list:

   ```bash
   git stash drop stash@{n}
   ```

### Explanation

- **Stashing Changes (`git stash save`)**: Temporarily stores changes that are not ready to be committed yet, with a descriptive message for easy identification.
- **Listing Stashes (`git stash list`)**: Displays all stashes in the repository, showing their reference and message.
- **Applying Stashes (`git stash apply`)**: Applies the chosen stash to restore changes to the working directory.
- **Deleting Stashes (`git stash drop`)**: Removes the specified stash from the stash list, freeing up space if the changes are no longer needed.

Git stash helps manage temporary work in progress efficiently, allowing you to switch tasks without losing changes or committing unfinished work. It's a valuable tool in Git workflows for handling unforeseen tasks or urgent fixes while maintaining a clean commit history.
