To squash commits means to combine multiple consecutive commits into a single commit. This process helps to clean up the commit history by consolidating related changes and making it easier to review. Let's walk through a scenario where we squash commits using `git rebase -i` to combine three commits into one.

### Scenario: Squashing Commits

#### Introduction

In this scenario, we have a feature branch with three commits (`Commit 1`, `Commit 2`, `Commit 3`) that we want to squash into a single commit before merging into the main branch.

#### Example Commands and Output

1. **Navigate to the Repository**

   Start by navigating to your Git repository where you have the feature branch (`feature-branch`) that you want to squash.

   ```bash
   # Change directory to your Git repository
   $ cd /path/to/your/repository
   ```

2. **View Commit History**

   Use `git log --oneline` to view the recent commit history and identify the commits you want to squash.

   ```bash
   $ git log --oneline
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   abc1234 Commit 3: Implement feature C
   def5678 Commit 2: Fix bug in feature B
   ghi91011 Commit 1: Initial implementation of feature A
   ```

   Identify the commit hashes (`abc1234`, `def5678`, `ghi91011`) that you want to squash into a single commit.

3. **Start Interactive Rebase**

   Initiate an interactive rebase (`git rebase -i HEAD~3`) for the last 3 commits (`HEAD~3` refers to the last 3 commits including `HEAD`).

   ```bash
   $ git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```

   This command opens up an interactive rebase editor with a list of commits since the branch diverged.

4. **Squash Commits**

   In the interactive rebase editor that opens:

    - Change `pick` to `squash` or `s` for the commits you want to squash into the preceding commit.

   Example interactive rebase editor:
   ```
   pick ghi91011 Commit 1: Initial implementation of feature A
   squash def5678 Commit 2: Fix bug in feature B
   squash abc1234 Commit 3: Implement feature C

   # Rebase abc1234..ghi91011 onto main
   #
   # Commands:
   #  p, pick = use commit
   #  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
   #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
   #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
   #  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
   #  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
   #  d, drop = remove commit
   #
   # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
   #
   # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
   # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
   #
   ```

   Save and close the editor.

5. **Edit Commit Message (Optional)**

   If you squashed commits, the rebase will pause to allow you to edit the combined commit message.

   ```bash
   # Editor opens for editing combined commit message
   ```

   Edit the commit message as needed, save, and close the editor.

6. **Push Changes (Force Push)**

   Since you have rewritten history (squashed commits), you will need to force push (`git push --force`) the changes to update the remote branch with the squashed commit history.

   ```bash
   $ git push --force origin feature-branch
   ```

   **Note:** Be cautious with `git push --force` as it rewrites history and can cause problems if others are collaborating on the branch.

### Explanation

- **git rebase -i**: Initiates an interactive rebase where you can squash, reorder, edit, or drop commits interactively.
- **Interactive Rebase Editor**: Allows you to specify which commits to squash (`s` or `squash`), pick, edit, or drop.
- **Squashing Commits**: Combines multiple commits into a single commit to maintain a clean and concise commit history.
- **Editing Commit Messages**: Allows you to modify the commit message during the rebase process.
- **Force Push**: After squashing commits, you need to force push (`git push --force`) to update the remote branch with the rewritten commit history.

Squashing commits is a powerful technique to keep the Git history clean and meaningful. It's especially useful before merging feature branches into the main branch or submitting pull requests, as it consolidates related changes into cohesive commits.
