### Merging in Git: Scenario and Commands

Let's walk through a scenario where we merge changes from a feature branch (`feature-branch`) into the main branch (`main`) using Git commands.

#### Scenario

Assume we have a project where development is happening in separate branches for new features. We need to merge the completed changes from `feature-branch` into `main` to incorporate them into the mainline of development.

#### Commands

1. **Switch to the main branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Merge `feature-branch` into `main`:**

   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

   This command integrates the changes from `feature-branch` into the `main` branch.

4. **Resolve merge conflicts (if any):**

   If there are conflicts during the merge process, Git will pause and indicate which files have conflicts. Resolve conflicts manually in each file by editing them to remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), then stage the resolved files.

   ```bash
   # After resolving conflicts, stage the resolved files
   git add <resolved-file1> <resolved-file2> ...
   ```

5. **Complete the merge:**

   After resolving conflicts, complete the merge process:

   ```bash
   git merge --continue
   ```

6. **Push the merged changes to the remote repository:**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Explanation

- **Switch to the main branch:** `git checkout main` switches your working directory to the `main` branch.
- **Pull latest changes:** `git pull origin main` ensures you have the latest changes from the remote `main` branch before merging.
- **Merge `feature-branch` into `main`:** `git merge feature-branch` integrates changes from `feature-branch` into `main`.
- **Resolve merge conflicts:** If there are conflicts, resolve them in each conflicting file, stage them with `git add`, and continue the merge with `git merge --continue`.
- **Push changes:** `git push origin main` pushes the merged changes to the remote repository (`origin`).

These commands allow you to effectively merge changes between branches in Git, facilitating collaborative development and integration of new features into the main project branch.
